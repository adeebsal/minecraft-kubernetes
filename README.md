# minecraft-kubernetes

Some .yaml to create Kubernetes deployments for the Minecraft servers I run. Uses the itzg/minecraft container image
found elsewhere on GitHub as well as Docker Hub. Helm charts are available but had defaults I wasn't a fan of,
and seemed to be outdated relative to the iamge's environment variables, which made things confusing.
